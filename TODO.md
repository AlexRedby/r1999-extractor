# TODO

Keep only game-specific extraction and source-asset preparation here. VNTTS
owns speech synthesis, generation jobs, model evaluation, and final game-pack
assembly. Completed work is recorded in git history and stable behavior belongs
in project documentation.

## Source voice coverage

- [ ] Add or explicitly assign references for the remaining 51 patch 3.7 lines
      whose 15 speakers are not covered by the current voice manifest. Do not
      silently render named characters with the narrator voice. Silverwing
      Eagle and eleven other patch speakers now use verified local game audio.
      The exhaustive installed-data blockers and required future identity
      evidence are recorded in `docs/source-voice-coverage.md`.
